          DIabetes</h2>
        <div class="mb-4">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/guncel/Diyabette Beslenme.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>In the nutrition principles published by the American Diabetes Association Nutrition Committee in 1994, it
          was reported that the concept of "<b>Medical Nutrition Therapy in Diabetes</b>" should be used instead of
          "Diabetes Diet", and that individuals with diabetes can use carbohydrate in a balanced meal plan by replacing
          it with a sugar-containing food. In the article of the same committee published in Diabetes Care magazine in
          May 1994, it is stated that scientific evidence supporting the theory that starch increases blood sugar due to
          the faster digestion of simple sugar is insufficient. So why are these suggestions important for individuals
          with diabetes? </p>
        <p>Today, in the light of this information, the importance of the total amount of carbohydrates consumed by the
          diabetic person is emphasized and the <b>carbohydrate counting method</b> is used for planning meals in the
          process of medical nutrition treatment. With this method, the patients receive information and training from
          the dietician about the amount of carbohydrates they should consume at main meals and snacks and makes the
          food choices according to the amount of carbohydrates they will consume. Diabetics taking insulin therapy
          determine the amount of carbohydrates they will consume before meals by getting adequate nutritional
          education. They adjust the dose of insulin they inject in accordance with the amount of carbohydrates they
          will consume. In this way, with their blood glucose measurements at home, they have the opportunity to monitor
          the effect of the carbohydrate they produced and the dose of insulin they apply, on their level of blood
          sugar.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">What should you eat for a healthy diet?</p>
        <p>In order to prepare the nutrition plan, many people with diabetes change the type of food or the mealtime
          they eat with the family and prepare a separate meal for themselves. However, there is not any difference
          between the principles of a healthy nutrition plan recommended to individuals with and without diabetes today.
          Diabetes does not affect the individual's level of the need for essential nutrients. With the nutrition plan;
          it is ensured that the energy and nutrient requirement, which changes according to individual characteristics,
          is met from various foods in a way to provide adequate and balanced nutrition. </p>
        <p>A person without diabetes is also recommended to limit the consumption of refined sugar or to consume foods
          rich in saturated fat and cholesterol such as meat, milk, yogurt, cheese, eggs. They should eat less and more
          often. For a healthy diet, foods containing the following nutrients should be taken in sufficient amounts and
          in a balanced way:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Carbohydrates (Cereals, flour-based foods, legumes, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits)
          </li>
          <li>Protein (Meat, chicken, fish, eggs, cheese, milk, yogurt)</li>
          <li>Fat (Meat, fish, oilseeds, cheese, milk, yogurt, nuts)</li>
          <li>Vitamins and minerals (All foods, especially vegetables and fruits)</li>
          <li>Pulp (Vegetables, fruit, and whole-grain cereals)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="subtitle">How can we control our weight?</p>
        <p>Instead of following the diets you see in newspapers and magazines, <b>develop your own personal meal
            plan.</b> Share the plan you think might be suitable for you with your dietitian and ask for support.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Consult your dietician by recording your blood sugar, physical activity level, and the foods you eat.
            Keeping track of what you eat during the day helps you control yourself and see the nutritional mistakes you
            make.</li>
          <li>Increase your physical activity level. Walk more, use stairs instead of the elevator.</li>
          <li>Start by changing your eating habits. You can avoid eating unhealthy foods outside by preparing your lunch
            at home the night before and taking it to work/school.</li>
          <li>Avoid your emotional eating habits. To avoid daily problems, find other solutions instead of giving
            yourself food. Talk to your friends, listen to music, walk or exercise.</li>
          <li>Set a goal and get support from people around you – family, friends - to reach your goal.
          </li>
          <li>Do not weigh every day. Check your weight on the same scale with the same clothes once a week.</li>
          <li>Believe you will succeed. Remind yourself often that you do this to be healthier.</li>
